    <p>This is just placeholder text but it's all true. i really like godzilla, my favorite movie is shin godzilla. A hobby of mine is collecting godzilla movies and figures. I have an unhealthy obsession with eating ice. I have been drawing for millions of years, before the dinosaurs. Crafting is fun. working with faux fur sucks. i have been playing hockey for 11 years (since i was a grandma). my friends call me an old woman because i have bad joints. my dad is a programmer and he told me to write that programmers are lazy. those are his words, not mine! </p>
    <p>This is just placeholder text but it's all true. i really hate things that stress me out. i have a very low stress tolerance and overthink pretty much everything. Another thing i really dislike is dolphins. they are mean to other animals for fun. and also kids like them. I dont like practicing hockey which is probably why i suck at it. oh and i almost forgot that i used to have this classmate who was really rude and projected his opinions onto literally everyone so my friends and i called him radingus. radingus got expelled. speaking of children, i do not appreciate ipad kids. </p>
    <p>P.S. I don't like Kong.</p>
